# **Overview**
This app was created to automatically pick a restaurant for the user. On average, an American couple spends 132 hours each year deciding where to eat. That is almost 6 days each year! With the use of this app, not only are we hoping to decrease the time each person spends choosing a restaurant, but we’re also adding an element of surprise to the process, as the restaurants are picked at random based on the user’s location

This app uses HTML, CSS and Javascript to have a random restaurant picker.
